# Pacman
I wrote Pacman in the Assembly x86 programming language as my 10th grade final project. 
The first ghost goes in a constant path around the map.
The second ghost follows Pacman by calculating in which of it's sides he is and going that path (if Pacman is to the right the ghost goes right, if Pacman is to the left the ghost goes left and etc...).
The third ghost calculates were to go using Pythagoras theorem and is able to break walls and walk through them.
The fourth ghost follows Pacman using the pathfinding algorithm A*.
